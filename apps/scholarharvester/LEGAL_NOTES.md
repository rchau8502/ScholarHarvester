# Legal Notes

- ScholarHarvester v2 never scrapes ASSIST.org (only uses authorized admin exports supplied by campuses).
- All adapters fetch official endpoints that explicitly allow automation; the robots.txt decision is recorded per source.
- We throttle to at least 2 seconds per domain and honor any `Disallow` directives.
- This project is not affiliated with UC, CSU, CCCCO, or ASSIST. All metrics cite their source and interpretation notes.
